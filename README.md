## Inspiration

Imagine a world where you have the power to shape the Amazon marketplace. Our app allows you to vote on different Amazon products, influencing what stays and what goes. No more tedious review reading, just a simple and easy way to make your voice heard. Join us in revolutionizing the way we shop online and creating a marketplace that genuinely cares about the needs of the people.


## What it does

Our app allows users to vote on different Amazon products. By simplifying the process of shopping on Amazon, it eliminates the need for tedious review reading. The app's voting system allows users to vote "yes" or "no" on specific products. If a product receives enough "yes" votes, it will stay on Amazon, and if it receives enough "no" votes, it will be removed from the platform. This innovative approach to online shopping gives users the power to shape the Amazon marketplace and make it more user-friendly.


## How we built it

We built Votr using a combination of Figma for designing the user interface, JavaScript and React for building the front end, and Verbiwire API for integrating with Amazon's database of products. The app uses tailwind to style the pages in a visually appealing way. 

The app's voting system was built using JavaScript, which allows users to vote "yes" or "no" on specific products. The voting data is then sent to the backend, which is processed and stored in a database. The backend also integrates with the **Verbiwire** API to retrieve information about the products from Amazon's database.

Due to the time constraints, we weren't able to achieve the ideal project we wanted. As of now, the project allows voting only over 1 product, whose data we fetch directly from Amazon's database. 

An **NFT** is generated using a verbwire API every time a user confirms their vote(where they are sent to using **react-router**)

_The product was chosen at random. We apologize if this hurt any sentiments_

## Challenges we ran into

While building Votr, we ran into several challenges. One of the main challenges was integrating with the Verbiwire API. The API had a complex structure and required a lot of testing and debugging to ensure we could retrieve the correct data from Amazon's database.

Another challenge we faced was ensuring that the voting system was accurate and reliable. We had to carefully design and test the system to ensure that votes were counted correctly and that products were added or removed from the platform based on the number of votes received.

Additionally, we faced challenges in creating an intuitive and visually appealing user interface that would make it easy for users to navigate and use the app. We had to iterate on the design and user flow multiple times to ensure that it was user-friendly and easy to understand.

Lastly, we faced challenges in securing user data and ensuring that the app was accessible to all users as per the security standards. For that, we have deployed the website using **Vercel** and attained a domain name from **domain.com**. Currently, you can access the project from **_votr.tech_**.

Despite these challenges, we overcame them through careful planning, testing, and iteration. We are proud of the final product and believe it provides a valuable and user-friendly solution for online shoppers.

While our product might not be entirely foolproof or even completed as a market ready product, we are proud of the fact that we three were able to learn and implement a project in web3 just over a weekend, thanks to the **verbwire API** and **banks#8744** for guiding us.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are incredibly proud of the accomplishments we achieved while building Votr. One of the main accomplishments we're proud of is the successful integration with the Verbiwire API. This allowed us to retrieve a wide range of product data from Amazon's database and would allow our users to vote on many products.

We are also proud of the user interface we created for the app. It's intuitive, visually appealing, and easy to navigate, which makes it user-friendly and easy to understand.

Lastly, we are proud of the security measures we took to protect user data and ensure the app is accessible to all users. We took extra care to ensure the data was saved and the app was accessible to users across the globe, by hosting the application.

Overall, these accomplishments result from our hard work and dedication, and we are excited to see how our app will be used and enjoyed by our users.

## What we learned

During the development, we learned a lot about various aspects of software development. One of the most important things we learned was the importance of effective communication and teamwork. We had to work closely with different team members, each with their skills and expertise, and we needed to communicate effectively to achieve our common goal.

We also learned a lot about the technologies we used to build the app. For example, we gained a deeper understanding of using the Verbiwire API, which allowed us to explore web3 and build a blockchain based project within such a small timeframe. 

We also learned much about React, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We also learned about Figma, the design/prototyping tool we used, and we saw how it could collaborate with other team members and create visually appealing designs.

We also learned about the importance of user experience and accessibility. We realized that it's essential to make an app functional and easy to use, and accessible to a wide range of users. We took extra care to ensure that the app was accessible to users with different abilities and that the interface was intuitive and easy to understand. Being non-native speakers, we ensured that our words were simple, straight forward and easy to understand.

Finally, we learned about the importance of security and data protection(**SSL certification**). We ensured that the app was built with security in mind and that user data was always protected.

Overall, working on Votr was a great learning experience, and we are excited to continue learning and growing as software developers.

## What's next for Votr

Initially, we aim to complete the project as per our designs and integrate metamask signatures. Further on, we aim to make custom/uniquely-images for every voting.

"What's next for us" is to continue to improve and expand upon our app. We aim to allow users to vote on Amazon products and integrate with other e-commerce platforms. Further on, the blockchain reassurance opens doors for VOTR to become a solution bigger than just an ecommerce.

VOTR would grow onto becoming a complete voting platform where the consumers, ranging from classroom teachers to government bodies, would be able to conduct polls and maintain an immutable voting record on the blockchain. 

With help from web3 contributors, such as Verbwire, VOTR might help the world get rid of rigged online voting systems and similar malpractices.
